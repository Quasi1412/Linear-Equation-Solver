# Linear-Equation-Solver

Python code to solve Ax = b (both square and non-square matrices)
  
 i) First converts the input matrix into the reduced row echelon form using Gauss Jordan elimination <br>
 ii) Uses the Reduced row echelon form to identify the particular and homogeneous solutions or returns "No solution" in a case where there exists no solution.
